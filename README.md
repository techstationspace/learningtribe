We address the challenge of educational resources creation focusing on the context of OER (open educational resources). A course is a curated pathway for the learner's experience. When a teacher is building it, he needs to find existing resources, using both pedagogical and semantic criteria.

We aim to build a project for indexing OER in a distributed way and propose an ontology to Increase the searchability and discoverability. The learners will benefit from this framework, as they will easily discover alternative resources and relationship with previously studied resources.  To achieve this goal, existing metadata standards are used to leverage existing information about resources. We extend this metadata, providing information about knowledge and associations between resources and knowledge.

A knowledge element may be a definition, an exercise, a theorem, an operation sequence, etc., These elements are combined with attribute values to form a series of RDF triples.  User portfolio will collect the learning history and learning performance of the learners, with the goal of recording the visited resources and test scores in order to estimate the effectiveness of the learning path.
